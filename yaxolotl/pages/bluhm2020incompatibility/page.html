<h1>Abstract</h1> 

Abstract:  In this work, we investigate measurement incompatibility in general
probabilistic theories (GPTs). We show several equivalent characterizations of
compatible measurements. The first is in terms of the positivity of associated
maps. The second relates compatibility to the inclusion of certain generalized
spectrahedra. For this, we extend the theory of free spectrahedra to ordered
vector spaces. The third characterization connects the compatibility of
dichotomic measurements to the ratio of tensor crossnorms of Banach spaces. We
use these characterizations to study the amount of incompatibility present in
different GPTs, i.e. their compatibility regions. For centrally symmetric GPTs,
we show that the compatibility degree is given as the ratio of the injective
and the projective norm of the tensor product of associated Banach spaces. This
allows us to completely characterize the compatibility regions of several GPTs,
and to obtain optimal universal bounds on the compatibility degree in terms of
the 1-summing constants of the associated Banach spaces. Moreover, we find new
bounds on the maximal incompatibility present in more than three qubit
measurements.
